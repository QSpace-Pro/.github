## üöÄ Overview

QSpace Pro is a powerful macOS productivity application designed to manage and restore your browser tabs, windows, and workspace context with precision and ease. When you constantly juggle multiple projects ‚Äî each in its own browser session ‚Äî or use different devices, tabs and windows can multiply fast. QSpace Pro lets you take control by capturing your browser state, saving it as a ‚Äúsession,‚Äù and restoring it whenever you need to pick up where you left off.

Instead of losing tabs when your browser crashes or quitting sessions accidentally, QSpace Pro snapshots your open tabs (across multiple browsers if supported), window layouts, and even the scroll positions for each tab. It allows you to group related tabs and windows under named projects ‚Äî for example, a ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù session, a ‚ÄúDesign Work‚Äù session, or ‚ÄúWriting Mode.‚Äù You can quickly switch between them, freeing your desktop of clutter but never losing your place.

Moreover, QSpace Pro includes advanced search and filter functions. When your sessions accumulate over time, you can search within your saved tabs by URL, page title, or keyword, enabling you to retrieve content from old work. Snapshots are incremental and optimized, so only changed tabs/windows are saved, reducing storage use while ensuring reliable restores.

The app supports cloud syncing (optional) so you can access your sessions across devices, and automatic backup so you never worry about losing your saved work. Whether you‚Äôre a power user, researcher, writer, coder, or designer, QSpace Pro turns browser chaos into organized productivity ‚Äî ensuring you always pick up exactly where you stopped, across multiple devices, in multiple sessions.
